# Quis

*Lightweight story module sorting.*

Based on the Latin word *quis*, this project, like its origin, implies a question of existing complex data. Quis provides a domain specific language (DSL) for performing comparisons on values within a state or global collection using strings.

Primarily, Quis is designed story sorting for use with quality-based or storylet structures where comparisons are needed to select or sort narrative content.
